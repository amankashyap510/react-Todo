# react-Todo
A very simple Todo application which is covering all the fundamental concepts of react including state management scenerios.
It is not divided in components since I want it to make all logic in single file.

Under the development I have used useState hook to update the current state and useEffect for restricting the data lost in page relaoding using local storage conditions.
